I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Computational Mathematics group at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), WA, where I work on the project "High-Dimensional Model Inversion and Uncertainty Quantification for Complex Systems." My research expertise lies at the intersection of Bayesian inference, structural dynamics, and machine learning, with a strong focus on model updating and uncertainty quantification for large-scale engineering systems.

Prior to joining PNNL, I completed a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at [CERL group](https://reliadesign.net/) under the supervision of [Prof. Zhen Hu](https://umdearborn.edu/people-um-dearborn/zhen-hu). During this time, I participated in multiple projects involving machine learning, structural health monitoring, and vehicle crashworthiness design, collaborating with industry partners such as Ford Motor Company and the U.S. Army.

I hold a Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering (Structural Engineering) from the University of Louisville, advised by [Prof. Young Hoon Kim](https://engineering.louisville.edu/faculty/young-h-kim/). My dissertation focused on integrating data-driven modal analysis with Bayesian inference for hybrid structural health monitoring. I also hold a Master degree in Bridge Engineering from Chongqing Jiaotong University and a Bachelor degree from Xihua University.
